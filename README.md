# ML Resources
My machine learning notebooks

### Learning Points
- Classification of images using Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron and CNN on the MNIST Dataset.
- Sentiment analysis and text classification using SWEM, RNNs, LSTMs, GRU. Used pre-trained word vectors from ConceptNet Numberbatch as well as learned word embeddings from AG News dataset.
- Reinforcement Learning techniques like Q learning, using it for OpenAI Gym environments like FrozenLake, as well as DQN, using it on CartPole.
